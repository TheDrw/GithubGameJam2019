# GithubGameJam2019

The end product at the end of the jam! I would like to thank github for hosting the [github gamejam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019). I pushed myself and learned a lot. 

While I want to continue to work on this game for another month or two, I won't be updating this repository anymore because I want to put assets that I don't personally own. With that said, feel free to use any of the assets in here for whatever you want.

Have fun and keep learning!
