The end product at the end of the jam! I would like to thank github for hosting the [github gamejam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019). I pushed myself and learned a lot. 

While I plan to keep working on this game for another month or two, I'll be fixing up some questionable code decisions I did during crunch time. But I won't be updating this repository anymore after that because I want to put assets that I don't have permission to share. With that said, feel free to use any of the assets currently in here for whatever you want.

If you have questions or suggestions to help me to improve my code, leave me a comment on my itch.io from above. Have fun and keep learning!
