  description: Get rid of those chickens!
  introWords:
  - Meow meow...Itchy itchy itchy. Why am I so itchy!?!
  - Oh, hello there!
  - I've been getting really itchy for some reason, and I don't know why!
  - I feel like it might be those flippin' birds behind that house!
  - Can you get rid of those chickens for me, please? Meow!
  finishedWords:
  - Thanks for getting of those flippity flappy flappin' things!
  - Meow!
  - Sadly, I don't think that solved the problem.
  - Maybe look around to find out some clues.
  - Luckily, I found these onions on a mountain when I got lost in a desert.
  - Have some. They recover health and are delicious!
